In this post, we will showcase some basic LaTeX syntax that can be used when writing LaTeX content in Astro.

## Inline Formula

This is an inline formula: $E = mc^2$, which represents the mass-energy equivalence.

## Block Formula

Below is a block formula:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

This formula represents the fundamental theorem of calculus.

## Complex Formula

We can also display more complex formulas:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_{a}^{x} f(t) \, dt \right) = f(x)
$$

This formula represents the fundamental theorem of calculus in differential form.
